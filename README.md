# Learn more
Here is my solution from "N.Kultin C/C++ in tasks and examples" Book. Will be added in time.
I'm a beginner in C++. This is my first challenge to solve all the interesting problems in this book xD.

I checked the solution on Ð¡Make because it seems to me more convenient than other C++ compilers.

I don't know if I did it correctly, ~~at first I wrote in Xcode in C~~, then I decided that I needed to learn how to do everything manually. went to VS Code and configured CMake. I check the tasks in `main.cpp`. You can look at the solution in the files in the `solutions` directory. Above each function I put comments with a **LITERAL** translation of the problem (Book in Russian). then I write the algorithm solution. I give the names of the functions according to the meaning of the task, for example, I need to find the area of a triangle, I'll call it `computeTriangleSquare()`. By the way, I name the files in the `solutions` folder by sections from the book, that is, if the section of the book is "Output" I give the name "outputs.cpp". That's all.
